    <h3>El mundo de Harry Potter</h3>
    <p class="info">
      Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997,
      the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide.
      They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of
      modern young adult literature.
      As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book
      series in history, and have been translated into eighty languages.
      The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history,
      with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the
      United States within twenty-four hours of its release.
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures.
      In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,
      making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

    <h3>sobre la autora</h3>
    <p class="info">Joanne Rowling (born 31 July 1965), also known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist.
      Born in Yate, Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1987 and began working temp jobs as a bilingual secretary. 
      In 1990, the idea for the characters of Harry Potter came to her while she waited on a delayed train. 
      The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother from multiple sclerosis, which deeply affected Rowling and her writing; 
      the birth of her first child; and divorce from her first husband. 
      She wrote the first Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997), while experiencing relative poverty as a single parent.
       Forbes named her the world's highest-paid author in 2008, 2017 and 2019.
    </p>
    <p class="info">Rowling has won many accolades for her work. She was named to the Order of the British Empire and was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. 
      Harry Potter brought her wealth and recognition that she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. 
      She co-founded the charity Lumos and established the Volant Charitable Trust, named for her mother. 
      Rowling's charitable giving centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children. 
      In politics, she has donated to Britain's Labour Party and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit. 
      Since late 2019, she has publicly expressed her opinions on transgender people and related civil rights.
       These have been criticised as transphobic by LGBT rights organisations and some feminists, but have received support 
       from other feminists and individuals.</p>
