      "Harry Potter, the boy who lived".<br>
      Since the release of the firt novel "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", on 26 June 1997,
      the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide.
      They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of
      modern young adult literature.
      The amazing seven books saga, managed to gain almost every heart in the world encouraging people to still believe in magic.

      little Harry and his journey from the 'muggle' world to Hogwarts. From that instance and on, the ride never stops and we will be
      wittnesses of all the wonders and also sorrows that Harry and his friends go through.
